    - No. It is a mark up language.

    - HTML does not have programming logic such as for loops, if conditions, variables.

- What makes a mark up language?
    - "MARK UP TAGS" create a mark up language.

- Is HTML the only mark up language?
    - No. We have more than 1 mark up languages.

    ex: XML : extensible markup language


- What is a mark up tag?
    - Markup tags act like containers.
    - It will change the behavior or display of the content passed into it.


- How many types of tags we have?
    - 2 types of tags.

#1- Paired tags     :
    - Paireds tags have <openingTag> and </closingTag>.

    syntax: <openingTag> CONTENT </closingTag>.

    Ex: p, h, head, body, html, li, div, ul, u, strong, button, select, span, em,
    a

#2- Unpaired tags     :

    - Unpaired tags have only
    - There is no closing tag.
    - That's why it is called self closing tag.

    syntax: </openingTag>

    ex: br, img, hr, input


What is an attribute:
    - Attributes provide additional information about specific web element.
    - Attributes go inside of the OPENING TAG ONLY.
    - If it is an unpaired tag/self closing tag it will go inside of the tag itself.
    - A web element can have as many attributes as needed. Number is not limited.

ex:
    <div style="color:red;"> content </div>

    <img src="cyberTruckimage.png">

TELLING WHAT IS WHAT FROM THE COLORS:
    - PURPLE    : TAG NAME
    - ORANGE    : ATTRIBUTE NAME
    - BLUE         : ATTRIBUTE VALUE
    - BLACK        : TEXT (DISPLAYED ON THE PAGE)

- WHAT IS A WEB ELEMENT?
    - Every single thing we see on the page is a web element of its own.
    - Such as: links, buttons, input boxes, images, headers

- input tag:
    - input tags are used to let user enter some form of input.
    - the type of the input accepted from user is determined by the value we pass into "type" attribute.

    syntax:
        <input type="text">

            --> to accept text from user

        <input type="password">
            --> to accept text from user,
            --> the text will be hidded as password

        <input type="button">
            --> to create button on the page

        <input type="checkbox">
            --> to create checkbox on the page

        <input type="radio">
            --> to create radio button on the page


- select tag:
    - Allows us to create dropdowns in the HTML page.
    - By itself it is not enough. We have to use <option> tag to create different options displayed for user.

    syntax:
        <select>
            <options> TEXT 1 </options>
            <options> TEXT 2 </options>
            <options> TEXT 3 </options>
        </select>
