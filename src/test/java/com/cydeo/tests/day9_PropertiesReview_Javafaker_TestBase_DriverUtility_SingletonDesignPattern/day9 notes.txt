- What is properties file?
- It is just another type of file just like .txt, and .pdf whatever.
- But this file has .properties extension.

- Why do we use properties file? What makes it different from other type of files?
- It stores value in "key=value" format
- We are trying to avoid hard coding some important test data in our project.

- What is hard coding?
- Writing data directly inside of the source code is called hard coding.
- If I have to go inside of my .java class to change the data, it means I hard coded that data.

- How do we read from properties type of file? INTERVIEW

#1- Create Properties class' object.

    Properties properties = new Properties();

#2- Create FileInputStream object to open file as a stream in Java memory.

    FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("pathOfTheFileWeAreTryingToOpen");

#3- Load "properties" object with the "file" we opened using FileInputStream

    properties.load(file);

#4- We can use properties.getProperty method to read from the file we loaded.
    (configuration.properties)

    properties.getProperty("key");  ---> value

    browser ----> chrome
    env ----> qa1.vytrack.com
    username ----> tester5@cydeo.com


- Which part of this is hard coded in our code : key=value
- "key" is what we write in our .java class.
- Therefore "key" will not change, and is hard coded.

- "value" is inside of our configuration.properties file.
- We can change the value from outside of our code


- What is ConfigurationReader? Why did we create this?
- To create utility method and be able to read from configuration.properties file by just calling our ConfigurationReader.getProperty("key"); method
